          <p>2D texture mapping.  The ground plane has a green 2D bullseye.  The
          left sphere has a blue 2D bullseye.  The right sphere has mottled
          texture, produced by using Perlin noise as a control source to cut
          between red reflectance and white reflectance.  There is also linear
          interpolation support, but I think the sharp cut looks much
          better.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <p>Transparency with chromatic aberration and caustics.  The
          sphere on the right has its index of refraction controlled by
          a 3D perlin noise map.  Note that chromatic aberration is
          visible in the caustics on the ground plane, and that the
          chromatic aberration displays the proper prismatic sequence of
          colors (ROYGBIV).</p>

          <p>The chromatic aberration looks a little too clearly-defined
          in this picture.  The model is the same as always -- I think
          the fact that it doesn't look as good is due to the extreme
          intensity and spectral content of the light source (CIE
          D65).</p>

        <figcaption>
          <p>A scene, including the Stanford bunny, viewed through a
          refractive / reflective sphere.  The sphere has an index of
          refraction <code>n = 1.5</code>, roughly that of glass.
          Physically-correct Fresnel terms are included.  The blending
          between refraction and reflection is done by Russian Roulette
          style, unfortunately resulting in a slight speckling.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <p>A scene, viewed through a dodecahedron defined by a
          polygonal mesh.  The dodecahedron's material has an index of
          refraction <code>n = 2.5</code>, roughly that of diamond.
          Fresnel terms are applied here as well, but the flat faces
          make the effect difficult to notice.</p>

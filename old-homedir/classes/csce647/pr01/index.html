  <h1>Project 01 -- 3D Scan Conversion with Supersampling</h1>
  <h2>Taahir Ahmed</h2>
  </header>
      
  <p> My scan-converter is implemented as a non-recursive raycaster with
  solid-color materials.  It currently supports spheres, planes, and
  cylinders in arbitrary orientations, although the scene description
  must currently be set at compile time.</p>

  <p> The code is available as
    an <a href="./ballistae-pr01.tar.gz">archive</a> or as an
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/ahmedtd/ballistae">anonymous
      git checkout</a> (tag csce647-pr01).</p>

      <p> The same scene, with 8x8 randomized supersampling.  There is
        basically no improvement over the 4x4 case.</p>

    <figcaption>      
      <p> The same scene, with 4x4 randomized supersampling.  The edges
      become softer still, but the improvement is not as dramatic as the
      jump from 1x1 to 2x2.</p>

    <figcaption>      
      <p> The same scene, with 2x2 randomized supersampling.  Note that
      the edges become softer.</p>

    <figcaption>      
      <p> The base scene, with no supersampling.  There are three
      spheres in front of the camera, two of which intersect.  A plane
      below the camera and a skew-oriented cylinder extend to
      infinity.</p>

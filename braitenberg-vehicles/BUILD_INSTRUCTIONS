This project uses CMake as its build system, and has dependencies on
Boost (a common set of C++ libraries), GLUT (a cross-platform wrapper
for OpenGL), and Armadillo (an expression template C++ linear algebra
library).

Install the dependencies in a location that is accessible to CMake
(This will be automatic on a *NIX) system).  Then clone the project
with git:

$ git clone git://gitorious.org/libkinematics/braitenberg_vehicles.git

Make a build directory:

$ cd braitenberg_vehicles
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

Configure and build:

$ cmake ..
$ make

Note the example configuration and --help option.

$ nano example_config.cfg
$ ./braitenberg --help

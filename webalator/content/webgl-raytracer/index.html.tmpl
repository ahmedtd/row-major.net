  <p>A simple WebGL raytracer.  It's implemented as a a fragment shader,
    drawn on a quad that covers the viewport.  Scene description and
    material data are fed to the shader in a truly barbaric fashion: as
    bytecode packed into a texture.

  <p>It's only been tested on a few platforms -- Firefox on Linux (Intel
    Graphics), Firefox on Windows (AMD Graphics), Chrome on Windows (AMD
    graphics).  Since WebGL combines the variance of OpenGL with the
    variance of Web standards, it probably won't work on any other
    platforms it hasn't been specifically debugged on.
